Summon is a tool that empowers web3 games with community-built and create-to-own gaming experiences.

Games can enable experiences where players can generate AI-created scenes as part of the storyline. This empowers players to not only play games but also take an active role in building and shaping their favorite games.

As an example, in the application, players are introduced to Post-Industrial, a real-time strategy game based in a post-industrial city that is on the verge of decline and transformation. Players can either collaborate with the mayor, a government official determined to revitalize the city or a businessman, a businessman utilizing the remaining resources of the city. 

As the game begins, players engage in conversations powered by XMTP with either of these characters. Each conversation begins with a prompt that encourages players to generate a new city design based on the intentions and goals of the character they are collaborating with while also ensuring the balance and stability of the city. We utilized XMTP since using its blockchain technology would promote thoughtfulness in generating designs, and it would enable players to have ownership over the dialogues they engage in with in-game characters.

Users can mint their scenes and dialogues as NFTs on Polygon zkEVM testnet chain. Polygon zkEVM is a fast, efficient chain. Long-term, we can mint from the marketplace address and use zk technology to include any of the user's game play information while maintaining their privacy.
